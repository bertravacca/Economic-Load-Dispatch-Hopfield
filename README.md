# Economic-Load-Dispatch-Hopfield
We apply a classic discretized Hopfield Neural Network to solve an economic load dispatch problem. We also focus on the geometric implications of Hopfield. 

-The detailed problem description can be found in the Matlab Live Scrip file 'hopfield_geometric_viewpoint_application.mlx' 

-The file 'hopfield_geometric_viewpoint_application_monte_carlo.m' contains a batch of simulations to compare our method to classic convex relaxation technique

- The file 'hopfield_geometric_viewpoint_application_geodesic_distance.m' plots the geometric behavior of Hopfield for one single simulation
