# Economic-Load-Dispatch-Hopfield
We apply a classic discretized Hopfield Neural Network to solve an economic load dispatch problem. We also focus on the geometric implications of Hopfield. 
The detailed problem description can be found in the Matlab Live Scrip file 'hopfield_geometric_viewpoint_application.mlx'.
